# CFWorkouts

This gem was specifically created to scrape the CrossFit website to view any workout of the day (WOD) within any given month in 2020. First you will select which month you would like to view. Then you will select a day within that month to get a print-out of what the workout is for that day. Now go get your sweat on and enjoy this little gem!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CFWorkouts'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CFWorkouts

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
